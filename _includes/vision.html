                    <h3>Bitcoin: Digital Gold</h3>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        Bitcoin has proved to be a bearer digital asset that can be transferred but not 
                        duplicated. 
                        Scarce in digital realm as nothing else before, bitcoin is digital gold with a 
                        secure embedded settlement network.
                        More a crypto-commodity then a crypto-currency, bitcoin aims to be a world reserve 
                        asset. 
                        The digital equivalent of gold could be disruptive in the current digital 
                        civilization and the future of money and finance.

                    <h3>Blockchain: Hype or Reality?</h3>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        Blockchain is just an append-only sequential data structure: new blocks are 
                        appended at the end of the chain, to change a block in the middle of the chain 
                        all subsequent blocks need to be changed. It is very inefficient compared to a 
                        relational database.
                        Blockchain requires an intrinsic native digital asset to solve the double-spending 
                        problem, i.e. to provide the economic incentives for the so-called miners 
                        (the blockchain back-office) to be honest. 
                        Without an intrinsic native digital asset providing seigniorage revenues, 
                        a blockchain would need to select and appoint its back-office operators, 
                        ultimately resorting to central governance.

                    <h3>Beyond Bitcoin: Timestamping</h3>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        A data file can be hashed to produce its digital fingerprint and this can be 
                        associated to a bitcoin transaction. The immutability of the bitcoin transaction 
                        provides timestamping, proving the data file existence at that moment in time in 
                        that specific status.
                        Timestamping is as reliable as the blockchain it uses, with the bitcoin one being 
                        the most tamper-resistant.
                        The process has been standardized as <a href="dgi.io/ots">OpenTimestamps</a>,
                        an open vendor and blockchain 
                        independent format that allows for third party auditability and is suitable for 
                        regulatory prescriptions.

                    <p class="text-muted">
                        Even if one is only interested in genuine technological applications of 
                        blockchain, the most promising field is the development of tools and 
                        practices for crypto-assets financial services, primarily custody for 
                        institutional investors and high net worth individuals.
