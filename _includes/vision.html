                    <h3>Bitcoin: Digital Gold</h3>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        Bitcoin has proved to be a bearer digital asset that
                        can be transferred but not duplicated. 
                        Scarce in digital realm as nothing else before, bitcoin
                        is digital gold with a secure embedded settlement
                        network.
                        More a crypto-commodity then a crypto-currency, bitcoin
                        aims to be a world reserve asset. 
                        The digital equivalent of gold could be disruptive in
                        the current digital civilization and the future of
                        money and finance.

                    <h3>Blockchain: Hype or Reality?</h3>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        Blockchain is an append-only sequential data
                        structure: new blocks are appended at the end of the
                        chain, to change a block in the middle of the chain all
                        subsequent blocks need to be changed.
                        It is very inefficient if compared to a relational
                        database.
                        Blockchain requires an intrinsic native digital asset
                        to solve the double-spending problem,
                        i.e. to provide the economic incentives for the
                        so-called miners (the blockchain back-office)
                        to be honest. 
                        Without an intrinsic native digital asset providing
                        seigniorage revenues, a blockchain would need to select
                        and appoint its back-office operators, 
                        ultimately resorting to central governance.
                        Blockchain is mostly an idiosyncratic technology for
                        digital scarcity.

                    <h3>Beyond Bitcoin: Timestamping</h3>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        A timestamp proves that a document existed in a
                        specific status prior to a given point in time.
                        Digital data can be timestamped attesting its 'hash'
                        in a blockchain transaction: the hash acts as a digital
                        fingerprint, 'uniquely' identifying the unmodified
                        original document; the transaction content and
                        timestamping is secured by the computational effort
                        performed after its blockchain inclusion.
                        Tampering with the transaction is computationally
                        intensive, to the limit of being economically
                        prohibitive in the Bitcoin case.

                        is a vendor-independent open protocol that defines a
                        set of operations for creating provable blockchain
                        timestamps and later independently verifying them;
                        as such, it allows for third party auditability and
                        is suitable for regulatory prescriptions.

                        Even if one is only interested in genuine technological applications of 
                        blockchain, the most promising field is the development of tools and 
                        practices for crypto-assets financial services, primarily custody for 
                        institutional investors and high net worth individuals.
