                    A timestamp proves that a document existed in a
                    specific status prior to a given point in time.
                    A digital document can be timestamped introducing
                    its <em>hash value</em> inside a blockchain transaction:
                    the hash value 'uniquely' identifies the document
                    (as if it was some kind of digital fingerprint),
                    the blockchain transaction extends its native timestamping
                    to the included exogenous hash value.
                    As a result, the <em>attestation</em> of the hash value
                    existance at a given point in time implicitly proves
                    the existance of the document prior to that given moment.

                    The timestamping and content of a blockchain transaction
                    are secured by the amount of computational effort
                    performed after its inclusion in a block of the chain.
                    Indeed, the more blocks are added to the chain
                    after a given block,
                    the more computationally intensive becomes
                    tampering with that block data; even just trying
                    to alter the timestamp of one of its transactions
                    becomes technically and economically prohibitive,
                    especially in the Bitcoin case.

                    Although there are many ways to realize a timestamp,
                    <a href="https://www.opentimestamps.org">OpenTimestamps</a>
                    is a vendor-independent blockchain-agnostic
                    open protocol that defines a
                    set of operations for creating provable blockchain
                    timestamps and later independently verifying them;
                    as such, it allows for third party auditability and
                    is suitable for regulatory prescriptions.

                    While anyone could timestamp with any permissionless
                    blockchain by paying the appropriate transaction fees
                    (using the OpenTimestamps protocol
                    or any alternative approach),                   
                    there are public OpenTimestamps
                    <em>calendar servers</em>,
                    free to use without any registration or API key.
                    They use the Bitcoin blockchain as a timestamp notary,
                    i.e. the proof is attested in a Bitcoin block header.
                    This webpage is an interface to create
                    timestamp proofs
                    using the OpenTimestamps public servers.

                    When a file is dropped in the box below, its
                    hash value is calculated locally inside the
                    browser without disclosing the document to third parties,
                    preserving privacy.
                    The hash is then submitted to multiple
                    public OpenTimestamps servers
                    (e.g. <a href="https://btc.ots.dgi.io">btc.ots.dgi.io</a>)
                    to obtain an <em>attestation proof</em>
                    of its existence (timestamp).
                    A (<i>.ots</i>)
                    <em>submission receipt</em> is immediately downloaded;
                    this is not an attestation proof yet:
                    it is incomplete and it cannot be verified immediately,
                    as it can take up to few hours for the transaction to be
                    included in a valid block.
                    In time, the hash value will be attested in a block:
                    then, the servers it has been submitted to
                    will be able to upgrade the submission receipt to
                    attestation proof.

                    using a local copy of the blockchain (e.g. a Bitcoin

                    this interface is just a facility and,
                    since a webpage cannot access the local filesystem,
