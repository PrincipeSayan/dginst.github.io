                A timestamp proves that a document existed in a
                specific status prior to a given point in time.
                Digital data can be timestamped attesting its 'hash'
                in a blockchain transaction: the hash acts as a digital
                fingerprint, 'uniquely' identifying the unmodified
                original document; the transaction content and
                timestamping is secured by the computational effort
                performed after its blockchain inclusion.
                Tampering with the transaction is computationally
                intensive, to the limit of being economically
                prohibitive in the Bitcoin case.

                <a href="https://www.opentimestamps.org">OpenTimestamps</a>
                is a vendor-independent open protocol that defines a
                set of operations for creating provable blockchain
                timestamps and later independently verifying them;
                as such, it allows for third party auditability and
                is suitable for regulatory prescriptions.

                Drop here a file to <b>stamp</b> it
                or a (<i>.ots</i>) receipt/proof to <b>verify</b> it.

            When a file is dropped in the above box, its hash value
            is calculated locally inside the browser (the file is not shared
            with anyone, preserving privacy);
            then, this hash value is submitted to the public
            OpenTimestamps
            calendar servers for attestation of its existence (timestamp); 
            a submission (<i>.ots</i>) receipt is locally downloaded.
            In time, the hash value will be attested in a Bitcoin block header
            and the receipt will become upgradable to attestation proof.
            <br>
            Indeed, if the file dropped in the above box is a (<i>.ots</i>)
            receipt or proof, first an upgraded proof is obtained from the
            calendar servers if available, then the receipt/proof status is
            displayed below.
