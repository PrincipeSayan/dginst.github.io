                    This webpage is an
                    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/ots/#ots_stampverify">interface</a>
                    to create and/or verify timestamp proofs using the
                    <a href="https://opentimestamps.org">OpenTimestamps</a>
                    protocol and its free public Bitcoin calendar servers.

                    A timestamp proves that a document existed in a
                    specific status prior to a given point in time.
                    A digital document can be timestamped introducing
                    its <em>hash value</em> inside a blockchain transaction:
                    the hash value 'uniquely' identifies the document
                    (as if it were a digital fingerprint) and
                    the blockchain transaction extends its native timestamping
                    to the included exogenous hash value.
                    As a result, the <em>attestation</em> of the hash value
                    existence at a given point in time implicitly proves
                    the existence of the document itself
                    prior to that moment.

                    The timestamping and content of a blockchain transaction
                    are secured by the amount of computational effort
                    performed after its inclusion in a block of the chain.
                    Indeed, the more blocks are added to the chain
                    after a given block,
                    the more computationally intensive becomes
                    tampering with that block data; even just trying
                    to alter the timestamp of one of its transactions
                    becomes technically and economically prohibitive,
                    especially in the Bitcoin case.

                    Although there are many ways to realize a timestamp,
                    <a href="https://opentimestamps.org"></a>OpenTimestamps</a>
                    is a vendor-independent blockchain-agnostic
                    open protocol that defines a
                    set of operations for creating provable blockchain
                    timestamps and later independently verifying them;
                    as such, it allows for third party auditability and
                    is suitable for regulatory prescriptions.
                </p>
                <p class="text-muted">
                    OpenTimestamps attestation proofs can be verified
                    independently from
                    any server, vendor, or sophisticated infrastructure, simply
                    using a local copy of the blockchain (e.g. a Bitcoin
                    <a href="http://bitcoincore.org/en/download/">full node</a>);
                    this interface is just a facility and,
                    since a webpage cannot access the local filesystem,
                    relies on public Bitcoin block-explorers for verification.

                    While anyone could timestamp with any permissionless
                    blockchain by paying the appropriate transaction fees
                    (using the OpenTimestamps protocol
                    or any alternative approach),
                    there are multiple public OpenTimestamps
                    <em>calendar servers</em>,
                    free to use without any registration or API key.
                    They use the Bitcoin blockchain as a timestamp notary,
                    i.e. they make the Bitcoin transactions that ultimately
                    attest hash values in Bitcoin blocks.

                <p class="text-muted">
                    To avoid the inefficiency of one blockchain transaction
                    for every timestamp, an OpenTimestamps server
                    provides <em>aggregation</em> of multiple hashes
                    (in a Merkle tree data structure)
                    and performs their <em>attestation</em> in a single
                    transaction (attesting only the tree root hash).
