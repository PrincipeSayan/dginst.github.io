                While anyone could realize a timestamp with any permissionless
                blockchain by paying the transaction fees, OpenTimestamps public servers
                are free to use without any registration or API key.
                An OpenTimestamps calendar server provides the aggregation of multiple
                documents and timestamps all of them at the same time using a
                single blockchain transaction.
                Moreover, a calendar server can offer its services to multiple remote
                OpenTimestamps clients.

                While the OpenTimestamps protocol is blockchain agnostic,
                a timestamp is as reliable as the used blockchain:
                <ul>
                    <li class="text-muted">
                        very reliable when using Bitcoin
                        because that blockchain is secured by huge
                        computational power (<em>proof-of-work</em>);
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-muted">
                        much less reliable with other public permissionless blockchains;
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-muted">
                        when used with private permissioned blockchain its reliability
                        depends on the trustworthyness of the chain governance: in this case
                        traditional certification authorities are probably better.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">
                It should be obvious, but it is worth mentioning that timestamping
                (using the OpenTimestamps protocol or any alternative approach):
                <ul>
                    <li class="text-muted">
                    does not prove authorship (that should be proved using a
                    digital signature);
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-muted">
                    does not ensure veracity of the timestamped document.
                    </li>
                </ul>
