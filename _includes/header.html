            <h1><em>Scarcity in the Digital Realm</em></h1>
            <p class="text-muted"> 
                The Digital Gold Institute is a research and development center about scarcity 
                in the digital realm (bitcoin and crypto-assets) and blockchain technology. 
                <br />
                Focused on its fellowship program, the Institute promotes the digital scarcity 
                experiment in the public debate and the scientific academia through R&D, teaching, 
                consulting, and advising. 
                <br />
                We explore the foundations and can assist in understanding them: cryptography, monetary 
                theory, computer networking, game theory. 
                <br />
                Of course, we <a href="http://github.com/dginst">write code</a> and love to get our 
                hands dirty in programming and technology.
