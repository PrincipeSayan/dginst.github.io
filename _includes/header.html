            <h1><em>Scarcity in the Digital Realm</em></h1>
            <p>
                The Digital Gold Institute is an excellence center
                about scarcity in the digital realm (bitcoin and
                crypto-assets) and the associated blockchain technology.<br>
                Focused on its partnership and fellowship program,
                the Institute promotes the digital scarcity experiment
                in the public,
                <a href="https://cryptoassetlab.diseade.unimib.it/"></a>scientific,
                and academic</a> debate
                through R&D, teaching, consulting, and advising.<br>
                We explore the foundations and can assist in understanding
                them: cryptography, monetary theory, computer networking,
                and game theory.<br>
                Of course, we <a href="http://github.com/dginst">write
                code</a> and love to get our hands dirty in programming
                and technology.
